abstract: "Using detailed administrative data on all cars and residents in Finland, we analyze the distributional implications of Finnish motor fuel taxes both across and within income deciles. We measure fuel tax burdens as the share of household income spent on fuel taxes, and estimate household-level burdens using car-level data on odometer readings, fuel economy and car ownership. Finland has some of the highest fuel taxes in the world, allowing us to observe fuel consumption choices made in an environment with significant fuel costs. Contrary to common belief, we find that fuel taxes are not regressive among all households; instead, upper-middle income households bear the highest tax burdens. Fuel taxes are regressive only among the 67 percent of households that own a car, as car ownership is much less common in the lowest income deciles. Most of the variation in tax burdens, however, is found within rather than across income deciles. Differences across income deciles explain only 1.5 percent of the variation in fuel tax burdens. We find that households that are located outside city centers, have children, or include employed people face higher tax burdens within income deciles. While average fuel tax burdens across income deciles could easily be equalized by redistributing the tax revenue, the within-decile differences are nearly impossible to eliminate even with targeted transfers. This is because less than 50 percent of the overall variation in fuel taxes paid is explained by observable household characteristics."
