I am a researcher at the [VATT Institute for Economic Research](https://https://vatt.fi/en/frontpage) and a PhD Candidate at [Aalto University](https://https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics) with research interests in the fields of environmental and public economics. My research focuses on studying the effectiveness and distributional impacts of policies aimed at reducing emissions in the transportation sector.
